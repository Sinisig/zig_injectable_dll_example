# zig_injectable_dll_example
Example for writing an injectable internal DLL for Windows with Zig

### What?
I couldn't find any documentation or other code examples for writing an injectable DLL for Windows using Zig, so I did it myself.
The code is simple and heavily commented to make it as easy as possible to see how it works, even for those new to Zig.
You may freely copy+paste this code into your own code projects if you wish, though I recommend using this only as a reference for writing cross-platform and idiomatic high-level interfaces.
